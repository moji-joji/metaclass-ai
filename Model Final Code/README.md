# Attentiveness Detection in a Metaverse Classroom

## Description

In this repo, we have preprocessed the data which is generated by the [CPT Test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216300759) in a metaverse environment and then we have implemented different ML algorithms in order to measure the attention of a student in a metaverse classroom.

Here are the files description in the repo:

- parse.ipynb (Notebook preprocessed the raw data and implements different ML alogrithms)
- time frame analysis directory (Caught the time dependency of the data)
- time frame variation (Analyse the change of time frame on the prediction)
- lstms (Implementation and data of LSTMs and a try to run arima)
